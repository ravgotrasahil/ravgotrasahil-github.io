### My background

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Texas at Austin] (https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/faculty/sr55289), where I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in macroeconomics and time series econometrics. My research lies at the intersection of macroeconomic theory and behavioral economics, with a particular focus on monetary and fiscal policy in open economies.

My work engages with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, exploring how bounded rationality, imperfect expectations, and credibility issues shape economic dynamics and policy outcomes. I often draw on Bayesian econometric methods to estimate and test these models using both macroeconomic and financial data.

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Surrey, UK, where I was awarded the Postgraduate Researcher of the Year prize and held a Turing Fellowship. My dissertation—Essays in Behavioral Macroeconomics—examined how deviations from rational expectations affect the design and effectiveness of economic policy.

Before joining UT Austin, I held research roles at the International Monetary Fund, Deutsche Bundesbank, and the OECD, and served on the faculty at the University of Delhi. 

You can find more about my research, teaching, or contact me through this site.

### Recent work

In 2018, my colleague Nick Polson and I published [_AIQ: How People and Machines are Smarter Together_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250182158?tag=macmillan-20), with [St. Martin's Press](https://us.macmillan.com/smp/).  AIQ answers lots of question people tend to have about artificial intelligence.  What is AI?  How does it work?  Where did it come from, and how is it changing the world?  For more information, see my [Books and Articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/) page.  

Much of my recent research has been in maternal and child health.  My collaborators and I have studied the [impact of Zika virus](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1605389) on pregnant women in Latin America, the [burden of asthma](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/8/2194.short) in Texas school children, and why you shouldn't have your baby in the [9th hour of your doctor's 12-hour shift.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27343567)  See my [research page]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/), [my CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/share/jamesscott-CV.pdf), or my [software page]({{ site.baseurl }}/software/) for details.

### How to find me on campus  

My office is CBA 6.478 in the business school.  This is somewhat hard to find: it's on the 6th floor of the south wing of CBA, on the east side of the building, i.e. on the side facing Speedway and Gregory Gym.  The easiest way to get there is go up the elevators in CBA (not the ones in GSB).  When you reach the 6th floor, walk straight ahead under the sign for "Behavioral Lab," turn left, and continue following the hall as it bends to the right around until you find my office.  (NB: I have nothing to do with the Behavioral Lab, although I've had students remark that finding my office feels like a behavioral experiment.)

You can sometimes find me instead in GDC 7.516 in the statistics department.  This is on the 7th floor of the north tower of GDC.  Take the elevators on the north side, i.e. on the side of the central atrium opposite the little coffee shop.
