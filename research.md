I work at the intersection of **macroeconomic theory**, **behavioral economics**, and **open economy dynamics**, with a focus on monetary and fiscal policy. My research combines dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) modeling, Bayesian estimation, and insights from bounded rationality.

An up-to-date list of my publications is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ww_1EOMAAAAJ).  
You can also view [my academic CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/share/sahil_cv.pdf).
